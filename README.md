## C++ Projects

### Chess Game
- **Description:** A fully functional chess game.
- **Features:**
  - Allows two players to play chess against each other.
  - Implements all standard chess rules, including check, checkmate, and castling.
  - Includes a graphical user interface for easy interaction.
    
### Ctree-Ttrees
- **Description:** A project focused on constructing trees based on words that share common consonants or vowels.
- **Features:**
  - Builds trees (Ctree for consonants, Ttree for vowels) by grouping words based on shared consonants or vowels.
  - Helps visualize relationships between words with similar phonetic structures.
  - Useful practice with tree data structures.
    
### Digraph Analyzer
- **Description:** A tool for analyzing digraphs (two-letter phonetic combinations) in a given text file.
- **Features:**
  - Reads text from a file and identifies all digraphs (e.g., "th", "sh", "ch").
  - Outputs the frequency of each digraph found in the text.
  - Analyzes patterns of digraph usage for linguistic research or text analysis.
  - Can handle large text files and outputs statistics in a formatted report.

## C Projects

### PPM Image Manipulation
- **Description:** A series of functions to manipulate images in PPM (Portable Pixmap) format.
- **Features:**
  - Can perform operations like rotation, grayscale conversion, image blending, and blur effects.
  - Includes a pointillism filter that randomly applies color dots to create an artistic effect.
  - Focuses on binary file handling and image processing.
    
### Word Search Game
- **Description:** A grid-based word search game where the user finds hidden words.
- **Features:**
  - Randomly generates a grid of letters.
  - Allows the user to select words from the grid.
  - Highlights correctly identified words and keeps track of the user's score.
    
### Coin Calculator
- **Description:** A program that calculates the different ways to make a given amount of money using coins.
- **Features:**
  - Takes input of an amount in cents.
  - Outputs the different combinations of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) needed to form the total.
  - Optimized for minimal number of coins.

## Java Projects

### Flappy Box
- **Description:** A recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game, but with a box as the main character!
- **Features:**
  - Players control the box to fly through obstacles without crashing.
  - Implements basic game mechanics like collision detection and gravity.
  - Keeps track of high scores for replayability.
  - Difficulty increases as the game progresses with faster obstacles.

### BBST-PQ
- **Description:** Implementation of multiple data structures including AVL Tree, Treap, and Binary Heap.
- **Features:**
  - Supports insertion, deletion, and access operations with priority queues.
  - Utilizes self-balancing tree structures for efficient performance.
  - Compares performance between AVL Tree, Treap, and Binary Heap.
  - Includes unit tests to verify the correctness of each implementation.

### Sorting and Searching
- **Description:** Implementation of various sort and search heuristics on arrays and linked lists.
- **Features:**
  - Compares performance across different algorithms and data structures.
  - Analyzes time complexity for each sorting and searching method.

## Python Projects

### Sentiment Analysis
- **Description:** Analyzes Twitter posts and uses keywords to classify them as positive or negative.
- **Features:**
  - Processes large volumes of Twitter data.
  - Uses a predefined list of sentiment words to evaluate the sentiment of posts.
  - Outputs sentiment classification for each post (positive or negative).

### Box Collision Simulation
- **Description:** A program that simulates two circles colliding in a box and their movements constrained to that box.
- **Features:**
  - Tracks the position and velocity of two circles inside a fixed box.
  - Simulates collisions between the circles and the walls of the box.
  - Visualizes the simulation in real-time.

### Polynomial Class
- **Description:** A custom polynomial class with functions for common operations.
- **Features:**
  - Supports polynomial addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
  - Handles power operations and equality checking between polynomials.
  - Computes derivatives of polynomials.
